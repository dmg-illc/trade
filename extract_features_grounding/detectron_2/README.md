# Detectron 2 feature extraction

Running an object detector on our ads requires the installation of [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) (in case the latest version of the detectron2 repo does not work, please clone a version from January 2024).

We recommend using a separate virtual environnment to run Detectron2. After cloning the repo, place `det_2.py` inside the main folder and run it.
